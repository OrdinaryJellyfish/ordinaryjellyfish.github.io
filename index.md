:wave: Hey there. I'm Tristian.

I'm a web developer. I'm pretty fluent with JavaScript and :heart: Vue.js. I also know a little PHP :)

I have lots of ideas, but I generally never follow through with them. I should probably work on that...

Anyways, more about me:
* I have no brain.
* I've been around for millions of years...I even existed before dinosaurs!
* I can clone myself.
* I might be immortal. Maybe.
* You kill me, I still sting you.
* I can shut down a nuclear power plant.
* I've been to space!
* I come in many sizes.
